**Per-task checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows codestyle_guide.md

## Gate 3: Testing

- [ ] Assignment works end-to-end as described in proposal.md
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing assignments
- [ ] Dependencies properly declared

- [ ] No hardcoded values (configs externalized)

**Assignment-specific:**
- [ ] **Feature:** New capability works as specified
- [ ] **Refactor:** Behavior unchanged, all existing tests pass
