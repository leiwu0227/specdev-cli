# SpecDev Skills Library

Skills keep the default workflow light while adding rigor when needed.

## Two categories

### Always-apply skills

Read and follow on every assignment. Not optional.

- `verification-before-completion.md` - No completion claims without command evidence.
- `receiving-code-review.md` - Evidence-based review response protocol. No performative agreement.

### Invoke-when-needed skills

Triggered by complexity gate or specific conditions during planning.

- `scaffolding-lite.md` - Contracts and dependency map only (MEDIUM complexity).
- `scaffolding-full.md` - Full per-file blueprint with pseudocode (HIGH complexity).
- `systematic-debugging.md` - Root-cause-first bugfix workflow.
- `requesting-code-review.md` - Standardized review request packet for Gates 3-4.
- `parallel-worktrees.md` - Safe parallel execution model.
- `micro-task-planning.md` - Ultra-granular planning for high-risk tasks.
- `subagent-driven-development.md` - Fresh subagent per task with two-stage review loop.

## How to use

1. Always-apply skills: read at assignment start, follow throughout.
2. Invoke-when-needed skills: decide during planning (complexity gate), invoke only what's required.
3. Record each invocation in `assignments/#####_type_name/skills_invoked.md`.
4. Every invoked skill MUST produce a concrete artifact.

Add project-specific skills here as needed.
