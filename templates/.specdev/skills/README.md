# SpecDev Skills Library

Skills are organized as folder-based skills (with SKILL.md manuals, scripts, and prompts) and flat reference skills.

## Folder-based skills

### Main agent (phases 1-3, 5)

- `brainstorming/` — Interactive idea-to-design session
- `breakdown/` — Turn design into bite-sized executable steps
- `implementing/` — Execute plan with subagent dispatch and two-stage review
- `knowledge-capture/` — Write diff files after assignment completion

### Review agent (phase 4)

- `review-agent/` — Holistic reviewer with file-based signals

### Supporting

- `test-driven-development/` — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with verify-tests.sh
- `systematic-debugging/` — Root-cause-first debugging
- `parallel-worktrees/` — Git worktree isolation for parallel tasks
- `orientation/` — Router and decision tree

## Flat reference skills

### Always-apply

- `verification-before-completion.md` — No completion claims without evidence
- `receiving-code-review.md` — No performative agreement in reviews

### When needed

- `scaffolding-lite.md` — Lightweight scaffolding (contracts + dependency map)
- `scaffolding-full.md` — Full scaffolding (per-file blueprints)
