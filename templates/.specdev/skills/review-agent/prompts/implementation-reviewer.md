## Your Task

Review the implementation holistically:

1. **Design match** — Does the implementation match the design? Any drift?
2. **Integration** — Do all components work together? Any conflicts?
3. **Test coverage** — Are all behaviors tested? Any gaps?
4. **Scope** — Was anything built that wasn't in the design? Anything missing?
5. **Quality** — Any obvious issues visible at the integration level?

## Output

**Verdict:** approved / needs-changes

## Findings
- [Specific issues with file paths and descriptions, or "None — approved"]
