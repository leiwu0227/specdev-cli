# Skill: Micro-Task Planning

## Use when

- Risk is high
- Unknowns are high
- Change needs tight checkpoints

## Rule

Break work into very small, verifiable slices. Each slice should have one binary success condition.

## Deliverable

In `implementation.md`, tasks include:

- One behavior objective
- One verification command
- One rollback note

## Acceptance

- Task progress can be validated in small increments with low blast radius
