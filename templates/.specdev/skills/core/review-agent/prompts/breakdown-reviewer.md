## Breakdown Plan

{PLAN_CONTENT}

## Your Task

Review the plan as a whole:

1. **Coverage** — Does every design requirement have a corresponding task?
2. **Ordering** — Are tasks ordered by dependency? Can each task build on the previous?
3. **Granularity** — Is each task 2-5 minutes? Are any too large or too small?
4. **Completeness** — Does every task have exact file paths, complete code, exact commands?
5. **TDD** — Does every task follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR?
6. **Gaps** — Are there missing tasks? Unnecessary tasks?
7. **Integration** — Will the tasks integrate correctly when all complete?
