# Project scaffolding guide

## Purpose
Document a lightweight mirror of the production codebase so assignment documentation and real files stay aligned.

## How to use this directory
- Create subdirectories that reflect the real project structure (e.g., `src/`, `apps/api/`, `packages/lib/`).
- For each tracked file, add a markdown stub that includes:
  - Assignment IDs touching the file (`#####_type_name`).
  - File purpose and critical behaviours.
  - Outstanding questions, TODOs, or follow-up items.
- Keep summaries conciseâ€”this repository stores guidance, not full source code.

## When to update
- During Gate 5, after documentation and examples are refreshed.
- When new files are introduced or ownership changes.
- Whenever an assignment reveals insights that future contributors need near the code path.

## Suggested template
```
# File: path/to/file.py
- Assignments: 00012_feature_auth-flow, 00015_bugfix_token-expiry
- Purpose: Brief description
- Notes:
  - Important behaviour or integration detail
  - Follow-up item or monitoring reminder
```

## Tips
- Cross-link to assignments (`.specdev/assignments/#####_type_name/`) for deep context.
- Use stable identifiers for components to make diffing easier over time.
- Treat this mirror as living documentation; stale entries should be pruned or refreshed as part of new assignments.
