# Project Big Picture

## What is SpecDev?

SpecDev is a project that creates markdown files to formalize the coding process. It provides guides to help coding agents complete various tasks through structured assignments.

## Goal

Write markdown files incrementally to structure development workflows, making the development process repeatable and well-documented.

## Key Principles

- **Assignment-first approach**: All work happens through structured assignments (#####_type_name)
- **Quality gates**: Validation checkpoints ensure quality at each step
- **Documentation as code**: Scaffolding and documentation are first-class artifacts
- **Incremental improvement**: Build the system by using the system

## Living Documentation

As assignments complete, update:
- **assignment_progress.md** - Track status of ongoing work
- **feature_descriptions.md** - Catalog what's been built (see documentation_guide.md)
- **project_scaffolding/** - Mirror important source files with metadata

This keeps documentation synchronized with the actual codebase.
