The planning stage is an iterative process, with the following phases:

**Reference Example**: See `.specdev/_templates/assignment_examples/feature/00000_feature_email-validator/plan.md` for a complete example. 

- Gather Information: dependency check, read background, gather information 
- Consolidate Findings: gather information and create initial plan 
- Identify Problems: make a list of issues that need user clarification 
- Clarify with User: ask the user to clarify the issues one by one 
- Write Plan: write an initial simple step by step plan, ask for user opinion 

Iterate above until user approves. Show progress update. 

You can write your research notes to .specdev/assignments/#####_type_name/research.md
