# Knowledge Vault

This directory contains accumulated project knowledge, organized by topic. Agents read this at the start of assignments for context and write to it at the end to capture learnings.

## Branches

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `codestyle/` | Naming conventions, error handling patterns, test structure |
| `architecture/` | Design patterns, dependencies, module boundaries |
| `domain/` | Business domain concepts and terminology |
| `workflow/` | What worked/didn't in past assignments for this project |

## Workflow Feedback

`_workflow_feedback/` contains observations about the SpecDev workflow itself (not project-specific). These are collected by the maintainer to improve the workflow guides across all projects.

## How This Grows

- Agents create new files and subdirectories as they encounter new categories
- After each assignment, the validation step prompts agents to distill learnings here
- Periodically, agents consolidate and deduplicate during natural workflow pauses
- Keep entries concise and actionable — this is reference material, not a journal
