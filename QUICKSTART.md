# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Upload to GitHub

## The Fastest Way to Get Started

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
cd /mnt/h/oceanwave/lib/specdev-cli
./setup-github.sh
```

This script will:
1. Initialize git (if needed)
2. Ask for your GitHub username
3. Update README with your username
4. Configure git remote
5. Show you the next steps

Then follow the on-screen instructions to create the GitHub repo and push.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
cd /mnt/h/oceanwave/lib/specdev-cli

# 1. Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: SpecDev CLI v1.0.0"

# 2. Create repo on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Name: specdev-cli
# Visibility: Public
# Don't initialize with README

# 3. Push to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/specdev-cli.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# 4. Update README
sed -i 's/YOUR_USERNAME/your-actual-username/g' README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update installation instructions"
git push
```

## âœ… Test Your Upload

After pushing to GitHub, test that it works:
